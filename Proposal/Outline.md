# Breakdown of learning

Total hours of learning 400

- 10h Taught
- 12h Supervised
- 378h Independent

Assuming 30 weeks (During term times) = approx 13 hours per week / 2 hours per day.

Tuesday is a free day so 6 hours will be used as follows:

- 10:00 - 12:00 = Working on project. (2h)
- 12:00 - 13:00 = Lunch break 
- 13:00 - 15:00 = Working on project. (2h)
- 15:00 - 15:30 = Short break. 
- 15:30 - 17:30 = Working on project. (2h)

For the last work session most work will be updating documentation and pushing any completions to version control.
