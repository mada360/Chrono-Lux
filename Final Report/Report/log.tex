\end{itemize}

\subsection{November}\label{november}

There was a lot of time spent working on other modules due to deadlines.

\subsubsection*{First week}\label{first-week-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Working on the interim report and other modules
\item
  03/11/2016 - Exceeded word count and so need to reduce it to below
  2000
\item
  Reading into the Philips Hue API and trying out the app. The API seems
  fairly straight forward, though authenticating with the hub could be a
  challenge.
\item
  There is no need to handle the hub connection through JSON, there is
  instead a Philips hue library that can be imported for use. It
  provides extra functionality to handle all API calls, though I think I
  will opt for directly using the JSON API.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fourth Week}\label{fourth-week-2}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  02/01/2017 - Attempting to develop the layouts for my app. I'm finding
  a lot of the Android library to be deprecated such as snackbars
  replacing the toast messages; to handle these and correctly show them
  as per the design guidelines is not as straight forward.
\item
  03/01/2017 - Using the container layout with a nested linear/relative
  layout is needed to handle the snackbar and it is now rendering
  correctly. More issues have occurred as I would like a tabbed toolbar
  for navigating through the different aspects of the app such as
  alarm/light control/weather. The tabs require fragments and a
  pageviewer to handle displaying the correct layout and I'm having
  issues with the app closing on start. I have also made an icon for my
  app to replace the default green android.
\item
  04/01/2017 - I am still facing issues with the tablayout as it doesn't
  appear to render correctly and trying to access certain fragments
  closes the app. I'm finding a lot of resources are quite outdated and
  many show incorrect or incomplete implementations.
\item
  05/01/2017 - The tab pages are now working correctly. I have a spinner
  that can display multiple String elements, I am now trying to display
  alarm objects in the list instead but am having difficulties.
