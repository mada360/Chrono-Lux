\subsection{Design Considerations}\label{design-considerations}

The application will often be used within a low-light or dark scenario
and as such I will design the application to use a dark colour scheme.

A light colour scheme could be quite energising to the user and could
potentially make them more alert which is not ideal before going to
sleep and could extend the duration it takes to fall asleep, resulting
in restlessness.

It has been shown blue light in particular can affect the circadian
rhythm of the body which is used to regulate sleep patterns
\cite{oh2015analysis}.
