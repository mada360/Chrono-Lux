  abstract = {Using a new trichromatic colorimeter a series of colour matches through the spectrum has been made by ten observers. The results have been averaged and a mean set of trichromatic coefficients for the spectral colours derived. These results are compared with previous determinations made by König and Abney. The variations in the coefficients that have been found amongst the ten observers must, as a consequence of a new method of basing the trichromatic units, be attributed to variations in the process of reception, but their magnitude appears to be of a small order. On the other hand, there are big differences in the amount of the macular pigment in different eyes and probably some variation in its dominant hue. These variations have been investigated by matches on a standard white, results for 36 observers being given in the paper and a mean value determined. This value, combined with the mean spectral coefficients, has been used to compute an average locus for the spectral colours in the colour triangle, with white at the centre. Other points discussed in the paper include the technique of colour matching, the range of intensity over which matches remained valid, and variations of luminosity.},
