## Design Considerations

The application will often be used within a low-light or dark scenario and as such I will design the application to use a dark colour scheme.

A light colour scheme could be quite energising to the user and could potentially make them more alert which is not ideal before going to sleep and could extend the duration it takes to fall asleep, resulting in restlessness.

It has been shown blue light in particular can affect the circadian rhythm of the body which is used to regulate sleep patterns \cite{oh2015analysis}.
