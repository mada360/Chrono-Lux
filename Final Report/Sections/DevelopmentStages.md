# Stages of Development

For a complete project there are fundamental stages that need to be addressed, failure to address these stages can result in project drift resulting in the end result not fulfilling expectations or failing to achieve the requirements of the project.

It must be mentioned that although the term stages has been used, in many methodologies especially those that involve rapid development many of these stages will occur in either parallel or in quick succession; for example testing will often happen throughout development to ensure aspects of the code and design work as expected before extending the software further.  

## Analysis

The first stage of development is analysis, failing to analyse the problem or obtain customer requirements renders development practically impossible as the project scope can not be defined.
Analysis often requires the assessment of the problem or product to be developed and rendering it down into more fundamental pieces such as how to implement a RESTful API or store any data required.
During this stage it is common to perform competitor analysis by finding similar existing solutions to challenges that may be faced and to implement improvements over the competition and produce something objectively better to improve usability, experience, performance and any combination of aspects that can be deemed desirable.

### Problem Analysis



### Competitors

#### [Sleep as Android](http://sleep.urbandroid.org/)

This is the most feature packed alarm app available on Android that I could find.

#### [Cuckuu](https://cuckuu.com/)

Cuckuu doesn't have the same level of integration with reminders, appointments or weather as what I intend and it doesn't include any smart bulb integration.

##### Appearance

##### Features

#### [Wakie](https://wakie.com/)

Wakie is very different in how it intends to wake a user up and besides being an alarm has little to what my app will consist of. Wakie does have a very interesting perms though, that a stranger from around the world will be able to call you when you would like to be woken and talk about a topic you would like to discuss.

#### Appearance

With a very simple and clean design this app definitely looks nice and allows itself to easily be ported into the varying mobile platforms.

#### Features

## Design

During the design stage the User Interface (UI) and various aspects of the code are planned for development. By critically thinking about certain design aspects with regards to the requirements outlined from the analysis stage, designs of the software can be produced, this includes both the visual designs of the user interface and some of the software solutions that may be required such as certain tooling and frameworks that are available for development to produce more stable software faster by removing the need to produce custom solutions to aspects that have been solved and are found throughout programming.

### Designs

## Development

Throughout development everything that has been produced from both the analysis and design stages are implemented through creation and utilisation of software and assets such as images and sounds to produce the goal of the project, in the instance of a mobile application this would consist of producing and application that can run on the required platforms such as Android, iOS or Windows Phone and for the application to perform the tasks required such as sending and receiving messages and displaying them to the user in the case of a communications application.

### Platform

The development platform chosen is for Android devices, this is due to the lead market share of mobile devices and through the relatively simple and free development platform using Android studio and the Android Virtual Device (AVD) tools provided, with the AVD providing the ability to test applications on every version of Android available and with different device specifications such as screen size, screen density, on-board sensors and orientations.

With my personal phone being an Android device it is also possible to install, test and debug my application on a physical device which is often faster than a virtual device and can provide a better experience of what the application will be when deployed.

### Target Market

Through various factors including my chosen platform, I will be targeting the latest version of the Android platform 25 also known as Nougat with support for devices as old as version 21 known as Lollipop. My decision is based on the current version distribution statistics that show over 50% of devices are on versions 21 or higher and as such my target is the majority share.

Version 19 (KitKat) currently hold a 20% share which is a large portion, however these are older devices that are likely to be from poorer markets and due to the cost of smart-devices it is unlikely for there to be a high demand of support from my app for KitKat. Due to the release and support cycle provided by Google it is also likely for KitKat to be unsupported by the end of the year and as such I feel there are greater benefits to gain from the newer versions in place of using older development features and supporting deprecated code.

Due to time limitations support will only be provided in English, with the app having no alternative language support. From the restrictions and targeted versions I will be focusing on countries that have English as the native speaking language and areas of relative wealth as these are the most likely to have access to the required smart-devices.

## Testing

Often testing is an ongoing aspect of the development life cycle so that as aspects of the application are developed tests and unit testing classes are produced to allow the automation of testing. Performing ongoing testing is useful to indicate that code is working correctly and if during development if the automated testing indicates any issues these can be resolved as they occur instead of during feedback or after deployment, both of which increase development cost through having to hunt down bugs and maintain the application during the life time of the application.

### Tests

## Feedback

Feedback is crucial for assessing the success of a project, by obtaining feedback from testers or trial users changes can be made to improve the experience of the application. Feedback can be obtained during development by having people use certain aspects of the application as it's being developed. If during feedback multiple users raise complaints about the same aspects this is a key indicator to change that aspect of the application before full deployment to ensure a higher level of polish and maintain a higher level of respect and image.
