# Methodology

## Overview of types of methodology

### Development Styles

#### Rapid Applications Development (RAD)

By producing prototypes of the software quickly customers are able to test and provide feedback as the software is developed. This is useful as often requirements change and it's common for developers to produce software that isn't actually what the customer wanted.

#### Agile

Originally project management was slow to adapt to changes with user review coming in late stages of development. Agile however aims for incremental development with regular feedback. \parencite{agile} 

The most popular form of agile development is the Scrum \parencite{agile} scrum is suited towards small teams and requires close involvement by the product owner to provide regular feedback and review. 

#### Lean

Much like scrum and other agile methodologies aims to produce software quickly and involves close coordination with the product owner, where lean varies is that it wants to reduce waste by selecting the most valuable features required.\parencite{agilemethods}. 

#### Waterfall

Focuses on phases such as; requirement gathering, analyses, development and testing. Each phase is completed entirely before moving onto the next phase and is often depicted by the phases flowing steadily downwards resembling a waterfall.

#### Spiral

The spiral model is based on the incremental model and consists of four phases; Planning, risk analysis, engineering and evaluation \parencite{spiral}. A project will go through each phase multiple times in an iterative process or spirals. This is very well illustrated in the figure below.

#### Time Boxing

Involves strict deadlines rather than goals. By developing up to the agreed upon time and evaluating progress this can allow for steadier development and a set time in mind which provides a deadline for development.

Evaluating at the end of the time frame can show struggles in the development process and provides the ability to address them rather than simply spending more time to complete the goal.

## Choice of methodology

After assessing the various forms of project methodologies I have decided to use an agile methodology most notably the Lean methodology as this will provide me the ability to develop core functionality in a fast pace and add other features time permitting. To assist my development I will also be using time boxing to allocate time for my applications functions and allow me to perform regular performance reviews so I can identify time sinks and other issues to allow me to manage them.
