# Methodology

## Overview of types of methodology

### Development Styles

#### Rapid Applications Development (RAD)

By producing prototypes of the software quickly customers are able to test and provide feedback as the software is developed. This is useful as often requirements change and it's common for developers to produce software that isn't actually what the customer wanted, by providing them with quickly developed prototypes if the software isn't what they wanted or they would like to make changes the time impact has been reduced. This is especially compared to other methodologies such as waterfall where the entire project is completed start to finish with the aim of providing the completed software at the end.

RAD I feel is not suited to my project as I am developing software that I know the requirements for and so will have no issues with changes to the requirements. RAD however is more of an encompassing methodology which is built upon fast paced development strategies.

#### Agile

Is not a methodology but instead seeks for alternative project management style. Originally project management was slow to adapt to changes with user review coming in late stages of development. Agile however aims for incremental development with regular feedback. \parencite{agile} 

The most popular form of agile development is the Scrum \parencite{agile} scrum is suited towards small teams and requires close involvement by the product owner to provide regular feedback and review. There are other forms such as; 
- Extreme Programming, this a more disciplined approach to develop high-quality software quickly and involves continuous testing and planning
- Crystal, aims to be lightweight and a highly adaptable methodology and encompasses variants that can be better suited for different team sizes, project priorities and on system criticality. \parencite{agilemethods}
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), is a very early methodology to come from the RAD movement in the early 90's and it focuses on the 80/20 model where the useful 80% of the system that can be produced in 20% of the time, essentially leaving more complex aspects to the later stages of development. \parencite{agilemethods}

Agile and the use of scrum development would appear to be very well suited to my project as it will allow for rapid development of features in my application, by quickly developing the base functionality and being able to obtain feedback from my supervisor before expanding to the other features would be extremely helpful and would prevent wasted time if I need to make changes.

#### Lean

Much like scrum and other agile methodologies aims to produce software quickly and involves close coordination with the product owner, where lean varies is that it wants to reduce waste by selecting the most valuable features required. Lean also works well for groups of small teams or individuals as it has a focus on decision making authority which has been shown to be more efficient than hierarchical flow control \parencite{agilemethods}. 

#### Waterfall

Is not an RAD strategy and instead focuses on phases such as; requirement gathering, analyses, development and testing. Each phase is completed entirely before moving onto the next phase and is often depicted by the phases flowing steadily downwards resembling a waterfall.

Waterfall is slow to changes and delays in early phases can have a large impact on later phases and can easily end up missing the deadline. Waterfall is often easier to understand as it's a linear process and due to phases being performed to completion documentation is often more thorough than in agile methodologies \parencite{agilevswaterfall}.

Due to the slower nature of waterfall I don't feel it would be ideal for my project, although it's easier to plan and performing agile development will lead to a greater challenge in documentation, the flexibility provided by agile would suit my needs greater than such a rigid method like waterfall.

#### Spiral

The spiral model is based on the incremental model and consists of four phases; Planning, risk analysis, engineering and evaluation \parencite{spiral}. A project will go through each phase multiple times in an iterative process or spirals. This is very well illustrated in the figure below.

Each spiral builds upon the previous spirals and due to the repetition of the four stages risk analysis is more rigorous compared to other methodologies.

Due to how the spiral method works I don't feel it would be suited for my project as it requires multiple passes through each phase and as my project is relatively small and has a limited deadline I feel too much time would be spent on planning and risk analysis reducing my time developing and testing my application.

#### Time Boxing

Involves strict deadlines rather than goals. By developing up to the agreed upon time and evaluating progress this can allow for steadier development and a set time in mind which provides a deadline for development.

Evaluating at the end of the time frame can show struggles in the development process and provides the ability to address them rather than simply spending more time to complete the goal.

There are issues with this method of development as it is difficult to estimate the time required to complete a task and so underestimating the time box will regularly involve assessing unfinished work. Potentially worse however is over estimating as this would allow adequate time to complete goals but will not help in identifying issues with development and will also result in a more relaxed time scale that could easily miss deadlines.

This would be very useful in my project as it will allow me to estimate a time frame for each feature of my application, allowing me to reflect on my progress as well as for my scheduled meeting with my supervisor.


## Choice of methodology

After assessing the various forms of project methodologies I have decided to use an agile methodology most notably the Lean methodology as this will provide me the ability to develop core functionality in a fast pace and add other features time permitting. To assist my development I will also be using time boxing to allocate time for my applications functions and allow me to perform regular performance reviews so I can identify time sinks and other issues to allow me to manage them.
