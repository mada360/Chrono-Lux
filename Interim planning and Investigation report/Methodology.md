groups of methods or techniques grouped into methodologies

Agile - incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints http://agilemethodology.org/

Waterfall – one shot or once through model, natural milestones at the end of each phase, rigorous specification and planning
Spiral – the system to be implemented is considered in more detail in each sweep, based on the unique risk patterns of a given project
Time boxing - A timebox is a previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal. Rather than allow work to continue until the goal is reached, and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished.
