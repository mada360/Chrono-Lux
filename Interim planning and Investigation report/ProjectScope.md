# Project Scope

## Aims and objectives

What I will be developing over the upcoming months is an app to help users get out of bed easier in the morning in a useful and information rich way. 

My aims are:

- Produce an alarm app with all the functionality users are used to.
- Integrate Smart bulb functionality into the app to turn the light on in the morning with the alarm.
- To turn off the lights at night without having to get out of bed.
- Provide weather information for the day.
- Inform the user of their schedule for the day and upcoming events.
- Publish the application to the play store for download and use by others.

## Stakeholders

I have identified the following stakeholders:

- Myself - Not only am I developing the application making me a stakeholder, I am also very interested in home automation and waking up happy. 

- My supervisor, Marcus Winter - By accepting to be my supervisor Marcus is also a stakeholder for my application.

- The second reader - Will also be involved and will be grading my project.

- An expanding user base of smart bulbs - Although the market currently is small the cost of smart bulbs is decreasing making them more available to users.

- Anyone that uses an alarm - The largest stakeholder I have is anyone that uses an alarm on the
  Android platform. More specifically those who own smart bulbs or other connected devices.

## Communications

I will maintain contact with my project supervisor with monthly meetings where I intend to measure my progress against deadlines and goals, reflect on what progress has been made and address issues, challenges and for development advice to assist me successfully complete my project as planned.

Regular emails will also be used between meetings to keep in contact and keep my supervisor informed of what I intend to talk about and on my progress made.

## Installation Process

I would like to publish my application to the Play store once developed to a satisfactory level. To install an app from the Play store you can simply select the option to install the app and it will be downloaded and installed seamlessly.

I will be ensuring to develop to a high standard and ensure there are no issues, bugs or flaws with my application.

## Quality checks

During development I will ensure to maintain my code and follow the principles that have been taught to me and that I have learnt and will learn, in doing so my code should be easily maintainable, readable and extendable for possible extensions and stretch goals. 

I will develop a test plan as I continue to develop my application to allow me to note issues and ensure previous functionality has not been effected by further developments.

## How will I measure success?

My key performance indicators are outlined below:

- Alarm functionality
- Smart bulb integration
- Weather functionality
- Calendar Integration (Stretch)
- Text to speech (Stretch)

If I am unable to produce a working alarm app with smart bulb functionality I will have failed to achieve what I intended to develop and so these are my highest priority.

## Challenges

There are many challenges I will face during my project these include the following:

- Making my application extensible to other home automation systems such as the \cite{belkinwemo}. This would allow for greater flexibility and a larger target audience.

- Handling various devices, there are now many various appliances that are connected to home automation, from washing machines and fridges to door locks and CCTV. Many devices could be useful for morning and night automation, such as closing the curtains at night or turning the kettle on in the morning. Each of these devices will have different functions and are very different from one another. To be able to add several and include them within a scene/scenario to perform multiple actions would be a very powerful inclusion within the app.

- Providing a good level of home automation without making the app cumbersome or difficult to use. My target audience is average users who would like to wake up easier and more refreshed and have their days information available straight away. They don't want to spend ages setting up the light bulbs or struggling to find settings as they will get fed up and stop using and potentially uninstall the app.
