# Project Scope

## Aims and objectives

What I will be developing over the upcoming months is an app to help users get out of bed easier in the morning in a useful and information rich way. 

My aims are:

- Produce an alarm app with all the functionality users are used to.
- Integrate Smartbulb functionality into the app to turn the light on in the morning with the alarm.
- To turn off the lights at night without having to get out of bed.
- Provide weather information for the day.
- Inform the user of their schedule for the day and upcoming events.
- Publish the application to the play store for download and use by others.

## Stakeholders

I do not have a client that I am developing my application for and so do not have a pre-defined user base or stakeholders however, I have identified the following stakeholders:

- Myself - Not only am I developing the application making me a stakeholder, I am also very interested in home automation and waking up happy. 

- My supervisor, Marcus Winter - By accepting to be my supervisor Marcus is also a stakeholder for my application, he will be providing feedback and assistance through out development and will ultimately be grading me on my efforts. 

- An expanding user base of smartbulbs - Although the market currently is small the cost of smartbulbs is decreasing making them more available to users.

- Anyone that uses an alarm - The largest stakeholder I have is anyone that uses an alarm, many use the alarm that comes on their phone and others use stand-alone alarm clocks. By investigating the most popular alarms used by people I will be able to get vital information on what makes for a good alarm and what I should avoid.

## Communications

I will maintain contact with my project supervisor with monthly meetings where I intend to measure my progress against deadlines and goals, reflect on what progress has been made and address issues, challenges and for development advice to assist me successfully complete my project as planned.

Regular emails will also be used between meetings to keep in contact and keep my supervisor informed of what I intend to talk about and on my progress made.

## Installation Process

By developing for Android I will be able to make the app installation process very simple by publishing it to the Play store. To install an app from the Play store you can simply select the option to install the app and it will be downloaded and installed seamlessly.

I will be ensuring to develop to a high standard and ensure there are no issues, bugs or flaws with my application. By developing for the KitKat version I will be able to support over an 80% market share. \cite{androidversion} 

## Quality checks

During development I will ensure to maintain my code and follow the principles that have been taught to me and that I have learnt and will learn, in doing so my code should be easily maintainable, readable and extendable for possible extensions and stretch goals. 

I will develop a test plan as I continue to develop my application to allow me to note issues and ensure previous functionality has not been effected by further developments.

## How will I measure success?

My key performance indicators are outlined below:

- Alarm functionality
- Smartbulb integration
- Weather functionality
- Calendar Integration (Stretch)
- Text to speech (Stretch)

If I am unable to produce a working alarm app with smartbulb functionality I will have failed to achieve what I intended to develop and so these are my highest priority.
