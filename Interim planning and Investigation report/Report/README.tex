\section{Report MD to LaTeX}\label{report-md-to-latex}

\subsection{LaTeX}\label{latex}

There is one main .tex file called Report.tex; this file is the
formatting and outlining for any reports I will be producing, this file
includes ``reflection.tex'' which contains the basic content of the
report.

\subsection{reflection.md/.tex}\label{reflection.md.tex}

As writing in markdown is cleaner and simpler for me than writing in
LaTeX I intend to write my content in the markdown format and use pandoc
to convert the file to the .tex format to be inlcuded in the Report.tex.

\subsection{Produce Batch file}\label{produce-batch-file}

The produce batch file converts all .md files into .tex and then uses
pdflatex to typeset the Report.tex file. In the future to produce a
different report simply changing the include within the Report.tex file
to match the file name of the .md file with the report content.

The batch file also cleans up any files left over from either pandoc or
pdflatex to keep the folder structure clean.

\subsection{Extras and useful
information}\label{extras-and-useful-information}

I had used MikTex to edit the .tex files, however Texmaker is a nicer
editor allowing for code completion, spell checking and live views of
the files you're working on. It can be found

\subsection{Using Chocolatey on
Windows}\label{using-chocolatey-on-windows}

Chocolatey can be installed using the following command line promt from
an Admin instance:

\begin{verbatim}
C:\> @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
\end{verbatim}

Once installed using the following command will install pandoc and
miktex.

\begin{verbatim}
C:\> choco install pandocpdf
\end{verbatim}

Optionally running the following will also install Texmaker

\begin{verbatim}
C:\> choco install texmaker
\end{verbatim}

For the Atom text editor

\begin{verbatim}
C:\> choco install atom
\end{verbatim}
