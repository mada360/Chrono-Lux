  378h Independent
\end{itemize}

Assuming 30 weeks (During term times) = approx 13 hours per week / 2
hours per day.

Tuesday is a free day so 6 hours will be used as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  10:00 - 12:00 = Working on project. (2h)
\item
  12:00 - 13:00 = Lunch break
\item
  13:00 - 15:00 = Working on project. (2h)
\item
  15:00 - 15:30 = Short break.
\item
  15:30 - 17:30 = Working on project. (2h)
\end{itemize}

For the last work session most work will be updating documentation and
pushing any completions to version control.
