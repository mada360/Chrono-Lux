This is the most feature packed alarm app available on Android that I
could find.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://cuckuu.com/}{Cuckuu}}{Cuckuu}}\label{cuckuu}

Cuckuu doesn't have the same level of integration with reminders,
appointments or weather as what I intend and it doesn't include any
smartbulb integration.

Wakie is very different in how it intends to wake a user up and besdies
being an alarm has little to what my app will consist of. Wakie does
have a very interesting permise though, that a stranger from around the
world will be able to call you when you would like to be woken and talk
about a topic you would like to discuss.

\subsubsection{Appearance}\label{appearance-1}

With a very simple and clean design this app definitely looks nice and
allows itself to easily be ported into the varying mobile platforms.
