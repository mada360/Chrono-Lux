\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

There a currently several home automation systems available to the
public market including smart heating with the \cite{hive} and
\cite{nest}, automated lighting with the \cite{philipshue} and
integrated automation in the form of the \cite{echo} which provides a
wide array of functionality and can be linked with many of the
previously mentioned systems to provide whole home automation.

The market of home automation is growing while the cost of entry
decreases, with advancements in LED technology the \cite{philipshue} has
become more affordable. The \cite{echo} is also at a very affordable
price with Amazon keeping the costs low to increase market saturation.

Current devices use the Bluetooth low energy and Wi-Fi standards, often
with a internet connected hub to handle communications. Wi-Fi is
relatively power intensive and provides a bandwidth excessively large
for the application, while BLE has limited range.

New standards \cite{zwave} and \cite{zigbee} are being developed, both
using far less power allowing for extended battery life. Both have
limited range like BLE however \cite{zwave} is designed to create an
interconnected network between devices to maintain low power while
extending the range.
