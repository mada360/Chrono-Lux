# Specification 

## Deliverables
- activities must be associated with products
- products may be intermediate or end deliverables
- products may be technical, management or quality
- products will form a hierarchy â€“ some MUST be accomplished before others can be undertaken

### Stages
- A schedule of activites

### Risk Analysis

There are many risks present with any kind of project, I will be identifying the most relevant and predictable risks and assessing the impact that could be caused. By identifying the risks posed I can attempt to avoid and  mitigate these risks and plan for those that I can't control.

Risks                           Impact level   Reaction                                                 
------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
Sickness                        Low            Avoid getting ill.        I                              

Data loss                       Low            Mitigate risk with multiple backups and version control. 

Project complexity              Medium         Avoid making it too complex, or too simple.              

Scope creep                     Low            Avoid implementing features not outlined.                

Communication with supervisor   Low            Mitigate by keeping in regular contact.                  

Learning curve                  Medium         Mitigation by working with what I know

Table: List of risks.

##### Sickness
Besides avoiding getting colds and flu which pose little risk to the project, the only other form of impact would be broken bones etc.. This would impact my learning however I would continue

##### Data Loss
I have my data backed up on two devices, a local NAS and the online service MEGA sync \cite{mega} 

##### Project complexity
My project has been agreed by my supervisor and so I believe it is neither too complex or too simple for the grade I would like to obtain. I feel I have made my project achievable and would like to add more functionality as time permitted.

##### Scope Creep
It is very possible for scope creep to occur with my project however I will be ensuring I complete all the features and functionality outlined within my project proposal before attempting to expand/improve upon the application to ensure I have a fully working project.

##### Communication
By keeping in regular contact with my superviosr I intend to be able to get regular feedback on my performance and assistance if I need help. Lack of communication could easily lead to a gap in what I produce and the expectations of my supervisor and could negatively impact my final grade.

##### Learning Curve
I will be devoloping in the Java language and for a device that I am familiar with. Although it can be tempting to work on a project in a new language or try to implement too many features in an attempt to gain a high mark, I feel it is more important to finalise the application and have a fully working demonstration for submission.
