## Deliverables

My project has multiple deliverables that I will assign a level of priority to using the must, should, could concept. 

The deliverables for my project will be as follows;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity					Priority	Deliverable
--------------------------- ---------   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writing final report		Must		The final report for the project is crucial and will be undertaken through out the development of my application.

Developing a basic alarm	Must		The application, an alarm app is what my project is based upon and so I will need to develop this before I can develop any further.

Developing a better alarm	Should		The application, a basic alarm will work but I would like this to be an alarm app that has all the features found in any alarm app such as repeat alarms, multiple alarms, etc...

Smartbulb integration		Must		The application, the Smartbulb integration is a main bases of my project and so I will need to include this into my application.

Develop for smartbulbs		Should		The practicality of demonstrating smartbulb integration could be a challenge, by setting up a test platform using an Arduino or raspberry pi would allow me more control than external APIs.

Calendar Integration		Should		The application would be improved with calendar integration providing an agenda for the user in the morning.

Text to speech				Could		The application, text to speech is a part of the Android platform and can be used relatively easy and so doesn't contain much of a challenge to it's implementation.

### Stages

It would be na√Øve for me to provide a detailed schedule of the activities and stages for my project, however I can identify what I will need to do and in which order as well as estimate a time frame for when I intend to begin the activity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity				Time Frame
--------------------    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writing the report		Writing the report will be on going throughout the development of my application to allow me to assess my work, identify my challenges and to provide the technical research I undertake.

Design					First week will be spent on this. I don't intend to spend much time of the visual design of my application as it should be fairly simple and can be modified easily.

Prototypes				Will occur prior to new visual changes to my application. I will provide a dummy function to the visual elements that involve interactions to test the look and feel before implementing fully.

Basic Alarm				First four weeks, the basic alarm will be the foundation of my application and as such will need to be developed well using the principles I have learnt. 

A test platform 		Two weeks following the alarm development, this will take some time to develop

### Risk Analysis

There are many risks present with any kind of project, I will be identifying the most relevant and predictable risks and assessing the impact that could be caused. By identifying the risks posed I can attempt to avoid and  mitigate these risks and plan for those that I can't control.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risks                           Impact level   Reaction                                                 
------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
Sickness                        Low            Avoid getting ill.                               

Data loss                       Low            Mitigate risk with multiple backups and version control. 

Project complexity              Medium         Avoid making it too complex, or too simple.              

Scope creep                     Low            Avoid implementing features not outlined.                

Communication with supervisor   Low            Mitigate by keeping in regular contact.
