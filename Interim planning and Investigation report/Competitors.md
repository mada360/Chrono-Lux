## [Sleep as Android](http://sleep.urbandroid.org/)

This is the most feature packed alarm app available on Android that I could find. 

## [Cuckuu](https://cuckuu.com/)

Cuckuu doesn't have the same level of integration with reminders, appointments or weather as what I intend and it doesn't include any smartbulb integration.

## [Wakie](https://wakie.com/)

Wakie is very different in how it intends to wake a user up and besdies being an alarm has little to what my app will consist of. Wakie does have a very interesting permise though, that a stranger from around the world will be able to call you when you would like to be woken and talk about a topic you would like to discuss.

### Appearance

With a very simple and clean design this app definitely looks nice and allows itself to easily be ported into the varying mobile platforms.
