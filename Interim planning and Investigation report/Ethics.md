# Ethical Considerations

## Ethical Q&A

### What are the aims of the research?

The aim of my research will to obtain user feedback of the usage of my app.

### What are the methods of data collection and analysis?

I will provide the users a device with my app installed on it and ask them to perform various tasks and rate them in how easy they found the task on a scale of 1-10.

Another means of feedback will be for design feedback and for how they feel the design could be improved.

### Who are your participants?

My participants will be my peers and family, all of which are over the age for informed consent and fall between the ages of 20 and 60.

### How will they be selected and recruited?

There will be no means for selection as I intend to keep the research fairly limited to allow me to quickly review the feedback and allow me to make improvements based on the feedback.

### How will the sample size be determined?

The sample size I intend to be at least 10 users, however due to the set-up required for my app it will be quite difficult to perform research on a larger group. This is due to the network connectivity required.

### What will your participants have to do?

As sated above, the users will be asked to perform several simple and more complex tasks within my app so I can obtain feedback, this will include actions such as turning an alarm on and off, switching the lighting on and off and navigating the settings menu. 

### What potential risks to the participants do you anticipate?

There should be no risk to the participants as they will be seated during the testing and I expect the entire test to last no more than 10 minutes.

### How will you minimise/eliminate these risks?

Due to the minimal risk there will be no need to minimise or eliminate any.

### What potential risk to the researcher do you anticipate?

As with the participant the researcher should have no risks posed on them.

### How will you brief and debrief your participants?

I will brief the participants by outlining the test I would like them to perform. The debrief will consist of question on any extra feedback not already provided and on how I could improve testing for potential future user testing.

### Will informed consent be sought?

It is important for me to obtain informed consent and I will ensure that the participants are fully aware of what it is I will ask of them. All participants will be over 18 and have no learning difficulties and so will be able to provide full informed consent.

### If subjects are unable to give informed consent, what steps have you taken to ensure they are willing to participate?

This is not an issue as all participants will be able to provide full consent.

### Will participants be able to withdraw without penalty?

A participant will be able to withdraw at any time and there will be no repercussion for them doing so. Any partial research will be used up to the point of with drawl unless they do not want it to be, in which case the participants research will be destroyed. 

### How do you propose to ensure participantâ€™s confidentiality and anonymity?

The testing will be conducted with the participant and myself supervising. I will be present but not providing assistance with the usage of the app and only there to help with other issues or to full fill the data destruction provided the user would like to withdraw.

All data obtained will be written down on a questionnaire of which the user will not need to write their name or other identifying details. The papers will also be shuffled prior to processing the data to further obscure the participant feedback.

### How and where will the data be stored?

The data will be stored formally on physical questionnaires. The data will then be processed into a more usable format such as an Excel spreadsheet and stored on my password protected devices and accounts and will not be shared with any third party.
